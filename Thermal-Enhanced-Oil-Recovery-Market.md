**Good Value for Money, Especially for Market Forecasting**

What I liked most about the **[Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/thermal-enhanced-oil-recovery-market)** report is the structured forecasting approach and the scenario analysis. It helped our finance team refine our own projections. The report doesn’t overhype the market, which I respect — it presents both opportunities and operational risks clearly. My only suggestion would be to include more operator-specific insights or quotes from field practitioners. Otherwise, it’s a worthwhile purchase.
